This AI image has me worried. We know that AI takes others artwork without consent and with all the images it uses it is unable to ever be able to credit it sources.

I has DallE2 make me an oil painting of a pink bow since these have been really on trend latley. It was really well done and very cute. 
I have used this AI before so I expected it to do pretty well with an art prompt.
