I used chatgpt alot to check my code and see if it could corret the failure I had in my code. It was great to explain what went wrong and how I could improve things.

My design was heavly influenced by chatgpt due to it's input and advice but mine feels more realistic compared to the other other code chatgpt made for me. 

I learned a different way of doing things and chatgpt was like a helpful cheat sheet to check and compare my work while also explaining what I did wrong when I felt lost.
